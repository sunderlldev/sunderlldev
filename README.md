# Hi there 👋  
I'm **Juan Blas**, a Full Stack Developer from Lima, Peru.

My work is centered on clean, scalable, and maintainable code that delivers a solid user experience.

I value clear architecture, consistent practices, and code that’s easy to understand and extend.  
I’m always refining the way I write, organize, and structure my projects for long-term efficiency.

### What I enjoy working on
